features:

    Add custom option for docker daemon by altering "docker_custom_config"
    variable (json formatted).

upgrade:
  - |
    Docker engine configuration changes are now done in
    "/etc/docker/daemon.json" file instead of altering systemd unit (which
    gets removed if present). Also "docker_custom_option" got replaced by
    "docker_custom_config" variable (json formatted).

deprecations:
  - |
    Configuring Docker daemon by "docker_custom_option" (used in systemd unit
    file) is deprecated in favour of "docker_custom_config" variable (stored in
    "daemon.json" config file.
